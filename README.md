# Team Rewind's Rapid React Code

This is the code that we used in the FIRST Robotics 2022 game *Rapid React*. 

The structure of the code is very unorthodox when it comes to FRC as we're both using C++ instead of Java, and don't use commands. As a very small team but with highly skilled members, this helped us get faster iteration times and less issues with our code.
